# Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

**LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

## Intuition

Intuition: Binary search on answer. The capacity must be at least the heaviest
package and at most the sum of all weights. Binary search within this range.
For each candidate capacity mid, simulate shipping in order and count days.
If within D days, try lower capacity; otherwise increase.

## Solutions

### `ship_within_days_naive` — Naive

```python
def ship_within_days_naive(weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
    left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
    for cap in range(left, right + 1):
        total = 0
        d = 1
        for w in weights:
            if total + w > cap:
                d += 1
                total = w
            else:
                total += w
        if d <= days:
            return cap
    return right
```

### `ship_within_days_optimized` — Optimized

```python
def ship_within_days_optimized(weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
    left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        total = 0
        d = 1
        for w in weights:
            if total + w > mid:
                d += 1
                total = w
            else:
                total += w
        if d <= days:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```
