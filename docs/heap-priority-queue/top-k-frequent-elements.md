# Top K Frequent Elements

## Intuition

Intuition: Count frequencies with a hashmap, then use a min-heap of size k
to keep the k most frequent elements. The heap is ordered by frequency, so
the least frequent among the top k is evicted when a more frequent element
arrives. O(n log k) time.

## Solutions

### `top_k_frequent_sort_naive` — Naive

```python
def top_k_frequent_sort_naive(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    freq = Counter(nums)
    sorted_items = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [item[0] for item in sorted_items[:k]]
```

### `top_k_frequent_heap_optimized` — Optimized

```python
def top_k_frequent_heap_optimized(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    freq = Counter(nums)
    heap = []
    for num, count in freq.items():
        heapq.heappush(heap, (count, num))
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    return [num for _, num in heap]
```
