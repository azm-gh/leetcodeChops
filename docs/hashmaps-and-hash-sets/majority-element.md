# Majority Element

**LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## Intuition

Intuition: Boyer-Moore voting algorithm works because the majority element
appears more than n/2 times. We pair different elements together and cancel
them out. What remains must be the majority. One pass, O(1) space.

## Solutions

### `majority_element_naive` — Naive

```python
def majority_element_naive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # Time: O(n) — hashmap frequency count
    # Space: O(n) — frequency map
    freq = Counter(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    for num, count in freq.items():
        if count > n // 2:
            return num
    return -1
```

### `majority_element_optimized` — Optimized

```python
def majority_element_optimized(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # Time: O(n) — Boyer-Moore, single pass with cancelation
    # Space: O(1)
    candidate = None
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += 1 if num == candidate else -1
    return candidate
```
