## Intuition

Intuition: Use a hash set for O(1) lookups. A number is the start of a
consecutive sequence only if num-1 is NOT in the set. From each start, count
how many consecutive numbers exist. This ensures each number is visited only
from the start of its sequence, yielding O(n) overall.

## Solutions

### `longest_consecutive_naive` — Naive

```python
def longest_consecutive_naive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0
    for num in nums:
        curr = num
        length = 1
        while curr + 1 in nums_set:
            curr += 1
            length += 1
        longest = max(longest, length)
    return longest
```

### `longest_consecutive_optimized` — Optimized

```python
def longest_consecutive_optimized(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0
    for num in nums_set:
        if num - 1 not in nums_set:
            length = 1
            while num + length in nums_set:
                length += 1
            longest = max(longest, length)
    return longest
```
