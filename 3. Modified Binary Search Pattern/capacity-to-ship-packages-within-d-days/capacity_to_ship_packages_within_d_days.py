LeetCode 1011: Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/
"""

# Intuition: Binary search on answer. The capacity must be at least the heaviest
# package and at most the sum of all weights. Binary search within this range.
# For each candidate capacity mid, simulate shipping in order and count days.
# If within D days, try lower capacity; otherwise increase.
