LeetCode 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
"""

# Intuition: Modified binary search for a rotated sorted array. Even though the
# array is rotated, one half (left or right of mid) is always fully sorted. We
# check which half the target belongs to by comparing with the sorted half's
# endpoints, and search accordingly. This preserves O(log n) time.
