LeetCode 128: Longest Consecutive Sequence

"""

# Intuition: Use a hash set for O(1) lookups. A number is the start of a
# consecutive sequence only if num-1 is NOT in the set. From each start, count
# how many consecutive numbers exist. This ensures each number is visited only
# from the start of its sequence, yielding O(n) overall.
