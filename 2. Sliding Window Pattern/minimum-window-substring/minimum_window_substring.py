"""
LeetCode 76: Minimum Window Substring

"""

# Intuition: Variable-size sliding window with two maps. Expand right until
# the window contains all characters of t (formed == required). Then shrink
# left while the window still satisfies the condition, tracking the minimum
# length. This is the classic "minimum window" sliding window template.
