LeetCode 448: Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/
"""
# Intuition: The array has values in [1, n] but some numbers are missing.
# The naive approach uses a hash set to track what's present. The optimized
# approach marks visited numbers in-place by negating the value at the
# corresponding index — numbers at unmarked indices are the missing ones.
# This achieves O(1) extra space.
# Pattern: Hashmaps / hash sets — the naive approach directly uses a set
# for "have I seen this before?" The optimized approach implements the same
# concept in-place using the array as a makeshift hash set.
